# Responses & Insights

The real power of UserLeap’s In Product and Out of Product User Research is when the Micorsurvey’s start returning responses. At the top of the results page for each microsurvey you launch, UserLeap provides statistics to help you understand the microsurvey's status and performance throughout its run.
