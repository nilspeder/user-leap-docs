# Email

Email surveys are a classic method to engage customers for user research. UserLeap provides the ability to target customers, send questions, capture responses and quantify insights automatically from those responses. For this QuickStart we’ve outlined the simplest way to get started with email microsurveys.

## Tasks

1. [Define List of Users & their Attributes](email.md#task-1-define-list-of-users-and-their-attributes)
2. [Choose a Template ](email.md#task-2-choose-a-template)
3. [Design Questions & Audience](email.md#task-3-design-questions-and-audience)
4. [Launch Microsurvey](email.md#task-4-launch-microsurvey)

## Task 1. Define List of Users & their Attributes



1. Create a list of users to target and anticipate that you’ll need to transform the file into a compatible file format
   1. Minimally, you will need to upload a file that contains user\_id, email and a single attribute
   2. If no user\_id is provided, UserLeap will create a hashed ID \(and ID generated using an algorithm to map data\) on your behalf
   3. Please note that using an uploaded list like this may or may not create duplicate entries if you were to then identify that user by way of another UserLeap install at later point in your UserLeap usage
2. Access this sample file to support your UserLeap upload from step 1 above. 
   1. In most cases you’ll want to make the third column a “referral attribute”, meaning that it will be value you search for in the UserLeap survey design workflow

## Task 2. Choose a Template

Navigate to the "[Templates](https://app.userleap.com/collections)" section within your account to browse the expert written microsurvey templates. Templates are organized into use case collections to help you easily find what you need, like:

* Onboard More Customers
* Create Better Content
* Launch a New Product or Feature
* Recruit Interview Participants
* Reduce Customer Churn
* & more!

Choose the collection that best fits your business problem. Then browse, preview, and select the template that best supports your research.

1. Scan and hover over each template.
2. Observe the preview on the right side.
3. To choose the template, either select the template card or click the green "Customize and Launch" button on the right, under the preview of the template.
4. If you'd rather not use a template, you can always choose to "Create from Scratch" via the purple button in the top right corner to create your custom survey.

## Task 3. Design Questions & Audience

**For the question selection:** 

1. Review any templated questions
2. Customize your microsurvey questions by changing the wording, deleting, or adding a question. 
3. Click “Save Changes” after customizing
   1. Saving the changes of your microsurvey places it into a status called “Draft.”
