# Account & Billing

## **How To Access Billing**

UserLeap supports in-app billing \(powered by Stripe\) for any users looking to move between our [free and essentials tiers.](https://www.userleap.com/plans.html)

## UserLeap Essentials Options

UserLeap has **four** paid plans \(not counting Enterprise\). The four plans are: 

* Essentials - 10k
* Essentials - 25k
* Essentials - 50k
* Essentials - 100k

All four plans offer the same features and [access to integrations](../integrations/). Plan selection is based on the number of **monthly active users** to your application and/or page

#### **Monthly Active Users \(MAU\)**

MAU measures the number of unique visitors that are tracked \(or visit\) your page/application on a monthly basis

{% hint style="info" %}
A user that visits the page/app multiple times **in the same month** is counted as **one visitor** for that month
{% endhint %}

## **How to Upgrade**

Plan upgrades can go from:

* Free to Essentials
* Essentials Tier 10K to Essentials Tier 100K
