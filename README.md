## Getting Started

[**UserLeap**](https://www.userleap.com/) is a continuous product research tool that helps you automatically capture the user insights you need to consistently improve your product, user experience, marketing, and more.

While traditional surveys are slow, difficult to target, and lack context, UserLeap microsurveys are delivered automatically to specific users at specific moments throughout the customer journey — all within the product experience.

Before we begin with the specifics, let's take a moment to review the solutions available from UserLeap to support your research strategy.

UserLeap supports two primary delivery methods:

**In Product** solutions are described as delivering research engagement via

* **Websites and Web Applications** 
* **Mobile Applications**

**Out of Product** solutions are described as delivering research engagement via 

* **Shareable Links** 
* **Email**

The **In Product** methods may require a few more steps or colleagues to get involved while the **Out of Product** methods require very few steps or a need for colleagues to contribute to launching your first microsurvey.

UserLeap also supports a number of integration options which can help you refine your research strategy over time. For the purpose of our Quick Start guides, integration options are excluded but can be located in the ****[**Integrations & Connections**](https://docs.userleap.com/integrations) ****section of our documentation.
