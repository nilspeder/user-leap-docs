# Google Tag Manager

## What is Google Tag Manager?

Google Tag Manager \(GTM\)  is a free to use container that allows the user to quickly deploy and manage installation of code, usually javascript, on a website. Once installed, you can use your Google Tag Manager integration to send events and attributes. Deploying the UserLeap SDK via Google Tag Manager is one of the two ways you can get started with UserLeap. Installing with Google Tag Manager will allow you to: 

1. Identify users that are completing an action on your website/in-app product
2. Create events for the actions your users are taking on your website/in-app product
3. Display surveys based on a customized event
4. Filter to a specific audience, based on user-passed attributes \(like planType\)

 **Here are some of the benefits of Installing UserLeap via Google Tag Manager:**

* Little to no coding needed\*
* Deployment can be done in minutes
* The out-of-the-box solution encompasses most, if not all, user tracking needs
* Most install-based products provide their own custom template \(Including UserLeap\)

_⚠️ Some coding, or at least knowledge of javascript and HTML, will be required._ 

## How do I check if my website already has Google Tag Manager?

Oftentimes, Google Tag Manager deployment and implementation sits with the marketing team in an organization. If you are unsure whether or not it is currently being used, we recommend starting there.

Another option, is to check via the `inspect` option in your local browser \(video below\)

To open the `inspect` window in Chrome, you'll want to right-click and select "Inspect". From there, make sure you are on the `elements` tab in the developer window, and press `cmmd + f`  \(or `ctrl + f` on Windows\)

For further verification, look for a GTM container ID. The ID should will always start with **GTM**.
