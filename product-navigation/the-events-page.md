## **The Events Page**

Part of what makes UserLeap unique is our ability to target users in journey based on actions they take on a page or within an app.

We call these actions, events. The [Events Page](https://www.app.userleap.com/events) is where you can see all added events in UserLeap, as well as find diagnostics for how often those events have been triggered. 

There are three main types of events: 

1. Programmatic Events
2. Page URL Events
3. Interactive Events
