# Overview

## Overview

The [Overview Tab](https://app.userleap.com/overview) is the first page you'll see when you sign into UserLeap. Think of this as your main dashboard for keeping track of active research in UserLeap, and is accessible by all users added to your UserLeap account. 

On this page, you'll be able to "pin" modals that corresponding to active/previously active surveys within the UserLeap platform. You are limited to **6 pins** on the overview tab, and can change the positioning, title, and width of the modal by opening the settings dropdown \(top right of the modal\). You can also unpin a modal by deleting it from this view. All edits are managed by clicking into the eclipses dropdown in the right corner of the modal.

The contents of the overview tab are shared across accounts, so any changes/updates from one user will take effect for the other\(s\). User permissions can be managed in [Settings](https://www.app.userleap.com/settings)
