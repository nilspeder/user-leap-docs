# Microsurveys

## **Microsurveys**

[The Microsurvey Page ](https://app.userleap.com/surveylist/all)is home to all microsurveys in UserLeap. 

In this view, you can filter microsurveys by status \(All, In Progress, Paused, Completed, Draft, and Archived\), Platform \(All, Web, Email, Link, Mobile\), or by the survey author.

You can also create a survey from the button in the top right \(see above\). This will redirect you to our [Template Collections](https://app.userleap.com/collections).

**Microsurvey Actions**

* Edit a Microsurvey -  Make changes to your microsurvey. For more information on how to create & launch a microsurvey, visit our [Getting Started Guide]()
* Duplicate a Microsurvey - Duplicating a microsurvey is a common workflow and allows you to keep the questions, microsurvey logic, and audience targeting all the same. The most common use case is to re-create a microsurvey from mobile to desktop, or vice-versa
* Archive a Microsurvey - Microsurveys can be put to archive. Archiving a microsurvey will not impact your data, but will make it so that survey does not appear under the Status "All" filter dropdown. 
* View Results - Microsurvey results & summary
* Create a Template From Microsurvey - Allows users to create their own custom template, perserving all questions & microsurvey logic. The custom template can be found in the [Template Collections](https://app.userleap.com/collections), under **Custom Templates**
