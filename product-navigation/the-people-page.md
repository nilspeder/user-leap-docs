## **People**

Once your connection [is live,](../installation/) the [People Page](https://app.userleap.com/visitors/all) will populate visitor history for all tracked users on your website/application. 

**\*Note: all new accounts will have sample visitors in the People Tab**

There are three main columns ****in the People Tab that you should be aware of: 

* User: This is the unique userid that is assigned to the visitor by UserLeap

  * _This is not the userid assigned by the client and instead is referred to the internal visitorid_

  \_\_

* Email: The email of the visitor, sending [email](https://docs.userleap.com/installation/javascript-sdk#user-identity) is optional but provides a more consistent experience 

  * _setting the email attribute is optional is not required_

  \_\_

* Survey Status: Determines whether or not someone is eligible to receive a survey, based on the [global resurvey window](https://help.userleap.com/set-your-resurvey-waiting-period)

If you click on a visitor record, you will be taken to the timeline view. In the visitor timeline, you'll find all history pertaining to events, attributes, and surveys.
