# Microsurvey Editing

## **Editing Live Surveys**

UserLeap live edits of surveys can be used to accomplish the following:

1. Add questions to the survey
2. Change the order of existing questions
3. Edit/Add survey logic to existing or new questions
4. Make edits to question/response wording\* 

_\*changes to question/response context **are not** an intended use-case for the Live Edit feature. Doing so may lead to issues with data accuracy_
