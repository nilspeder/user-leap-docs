## Considerations When Adding a New Product

UserLeap identifies users by a unique identifier, `visitorids` and then determines whether or not they should be eligible to receive another UserLeap microsurvey

Users that are tracked through the new product are treated as **new users** and will carry unique `visitorids`. So in this case it is possible for the same user to receive more than one microsurvey within the same day.
