### **Configuring an Email Microsurvey**

Email microsurveys can be sent by:

* Using attributes that are sent to UserLeap from your backend \(or from [**Google Tag Manager**](../installation/web-sdk/google-tag-manager-new/adding-attributes.md)\)
* [**Using a CSV to upload**](../integrations/uploading-a-csv.md) user information \(including emails, user\_ids, and supplementing user attributes\)

**Using Attributes from your Backend**

Attributes that have already been configured and sent to UserLeap will show up in the dropdowns as a [**survey filter**](../product-definitions/interacting-with-survey-filters-and-triggers.md)\*\*\*\*

Once complete, attributes will be available to target in the [**survey filter**](../product-definitions/interacting-with-survey-filters-and-triggers.md) dropdown
