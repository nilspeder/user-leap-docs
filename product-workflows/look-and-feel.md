You can enter any valid HTML Color Code or leave it blank for the default color of Black \(`#000000`\)

By default UserLeap modals will appear in the bottom righthand corner of your web application, but you can change that to also support: 

* Bottom left
* Top left
* Top right
* Center

Modals that are centerally positioned must also choose between a light or dark overlay
