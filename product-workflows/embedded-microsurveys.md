# Embedded Microsurveys

## Embedded Microsurvey

Another delivery mechanism from UserLeap is the ability to embed a shareable link microsurvey. Doing so 1\) provides a better user experience 2\) increases the average response rate

If you're considering collecting feedback via email or newsletter, and want to add some personal customization, read on to see how you can better utilize UserLeap to automate that effort on your behalf.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Customizing embeds is only possible for Likert Scale \(1-5 rating\) or Multiple Choice - Single Select type questions. 
{% endhint %}

**Step 1**: Pick a survey template, or start from scratch 

For this example, we will use the **Evaluate the User Experience** survey template which is located in our product [**template gallery**](https://app.userleap.com/templates)\*\*\*\*

**Step 2**: Chose the shareable link option, as shown above 

**Step 3**: Design and Launch your Survey 

For this to work, question 1 will need to be either a Likert Scale or a Multiple Choice - Single Select question type. The example below covers a Likert Scale question type, but\[ \]

**Step 4**: Navigate to your Live Survey Link

Your Live Survey Link can be found on the Survey Responses page, near the top. In order to embed question one into our email/newsletter, we'll need to make some quick modifications to this survey link

Click into the "See Live Survey" and copy that URL to your computer's clipboard

Here's our example URL: https://surveys.userleap.io/534a635666712d3751517e7369643a37333535

**Step 5**: Make modifications to the URL 

### **Likert Scale:** 

Live Survey Link \(from above\): https://surveys.userleap.io/534a635666712d3751517e7369643a37333535

Copy and paste the URL into your newsletter, make the modifications as listed below

![](https://help.userleap.com/hubfs/image-png-2.png)

* * "?r=1" \(option 1\)
  * "?r=2" \(option 2\) 
  * "?r=3" \(option 3\)
  * "?r=4" \(option 4\)
  * "?r=5" \(option 5\)

### **Multiple Choice - Single** **Select**

Live Survey Link \(from above\): https://surveys.userleap.io/534a635666712d3751517e7369643a37333535  
  
First, we'll need to add a Multiple Choice - Single Select question type to our survey and reposition it so that it's now the first question  
  
For Multiple Choice - Single Select the URL modification is 'similar' but instead you enter in the EXACT phrase that corresponds to each of the options  
  
In this survey, the three URLs would be:   


1. https://surveys.userleap.io/534a635666712d3751517e7369643a37333535?r=its\_great
2. https://surveys.userleap.io/534a635666712d3751517e7369643a37333535?r=needs\_work?
3. https://surveys.userleap.io/534a635666712d3751517e7369643a37333535?r=definitely\_not\_working

* * If the response contains the following punctuation, do not copy over to the modified URL: 

{% embed url="https://share.getcloudapp.com/BluQOz8N" %}

**Do Not Include:** commas, apostrophes, periods

* * Any spaces should be replaced with an underscore 
  * Question marks should be kept in place 
  * Make sure all responses are converted to lower case

{% hint style="success" %}
**Correct**: https://surveys.userleap.io/534a635666712d3751517e7369643a37333535?r=its\_great
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Incorrect:**

1. https://surveys.userleap.io/534a635666712d3751517e7369643a37333535?r=Its\_Great
2. https://surveys.userleap.io/534a635666712d3751517e7369643a37333535?r=ItsGreat
3. https://surveys.userleap.io/534a635666712d3751517e7369643a37333535?r=it's\_great
{% endhint %}

**Step 6**: Determine what element you plan to hyperlink - common examples are text, images, or emojis 

**Likert Scale**: In this example, we decided to use emojis 

**Multiple Choice - Single Select**: If you have access to an email marketing tool \(like Mailchimp\) it might make sense to create your own custom buttons, or something similar.
