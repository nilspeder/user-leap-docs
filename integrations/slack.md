# Slack

**Note**: Using Slack may require access to admin permissions, please contact your company admin if prompted to do so.
{% endhint %}



The UserLeap Slack integration allows Slack users to push data from UserLeap to channels within their Slack workspace.:

* Billing Events and Notifications
* Launched or Completed Microsurveys 
* Responses Received to a Microsurvey
* Microsurvey Themes

### **Before getting started**

* The UserLeap Slack integration is available to all plans. 
* Only a **UserLeap Admin, Developer** or **Editor** on the UserLeap account can enable the Slack integration in UserLeap, while in Slack, channel creation and application integration [is determined by your Slack Administrator](https://slack.com/help/articles/201314026-Permissions-by-role-in-Slack). 
* Decide which channels and which colleagues in your organization should receive access to the UserLeap data sets that are available. 
* If you do not have the right Slack channels available and you do not have permissions to create Slack channels in your company, you’ll want to contact your IT, Security or team member responsible for the Slack administration to request that they create the channels you’ll need. 
* Similarly, if you do not have permission to install or connect third party applications to Slack, you may need to reach out to them to ask that they help you integrate Slack and UserLeap. 
* You may need to add your Slack Admin to the UserLeap account so that they can install the integration

Once you have the right Slack Channels available and have verified the permissions for integrating Slack, choose which UserLeap data sets you want mapped to those channels. If you are not interested in receiving a specific UserLeap data set, you can choose “Not Set” for the channel. Listed below are some general recommendations: 

**Surveys receive a response**

A channel with your whole product team or stakeholders that are interested in customer insights. 

**Survey themes are identified** 

A channel with your whole product team or stakeholders that are interested in customer insights. 

**Billing Events and Notifications**

Typically a channel for the UserLeap Admins, their procurement or accounts payable team. If not needed, select “Not Set”. 

**Survey are launched or completed** 

Typically a channel for the UserLeap Admins or central team that administers UserLeap at your company. If not needed, select “Not Set”. 

### **Connecting, Configuring or Disabling Slack**

You or your Slack Admin can connect your Slack workspace to UserLeap from within UserLeap by clicking on the Connect tab and locating the Slack icon [https://app.userleap.com/connect](https://app.userleap.com/connect) and choosing “install”

When you click the install button, Slack will prompt you to confirm the channels that map to the data available from UserLeap.

‌If you would like to remove the Slack integration, simply click the Disconnect button. This will remove the UserLeap App from your workspace and stop all notifications from being sent to Slack.
