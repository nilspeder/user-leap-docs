UserLeap observes user research best practices by limiting the number of times a single user may qualify to receive a microsurvey. 

This is known as a resurvey waiting period \(often referred to as a resurvey window\). Let's assume we have this set to 7 \(default\). What does that mean? This means that if we have two microsurveys, A and B, upon qualifying and being shown microsurvey A, the earliest that same user can qualify for microsurvey B is on the 8th day. Unless, they have set a custom resurvey window at the microsurvey level \(more on this below\) 

The resurvey window is controlled by you, and can be set to any number of days `>` 1

## How Do You Set a Resurvey Window

UserLeap has two distinct resurvey windows: 

* Global: Under [**Settings**](http://app.userleap.com/settings/configure) ****scroll down to “Resurvey Waiting Period” 
* Microsurvey level: Each UserLeap microsurvey survey has its own window 

### Global Window

The Global window is set when you first create your UserLeap account. We set this value equal to 7 days \(feel free to adjust accordingly\).

### Microsurvey Window

The microsurvey level window, as it sounds, is unique to that microsurvey. This means that each microsurvey has its custom built-in window.   


By default, this window will be set to the Global window.
